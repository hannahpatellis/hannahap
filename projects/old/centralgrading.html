            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>During the first quarter of 2020, Trilogy had a corporate goal of cost cutting inside their boot camp
              courses. In order to make individual boot camp courses more profitable, they wanted to reduce the number
              of Teaching Assistants in each class. Initially there was approximately one TA per 10 students, but that
              was proving costly. One main job of TAs in Trilogy classrooms was to grade homework assignments turned in
              by students, but TAs were already under a heavy load to make it through all student assignments and get
              students feedback in a reasonable amount of time.</p>
            <p>The problem was clear:</p>
            <div class="welton"><strong>How might we reduce TAs in classrooms while increasing homework grading turn
                around time?</strong></div>
            <p>Through brainstorming and working with stakeholders, a solution came out: Create a centralized grading
              platform with a team of dedicated graders.</p>
          </div>

            <h2>Users and audience</h2>
            <p>The users of BCS Grading would be central graders who were tasked with claiming homework assignments and
              then grading them, and central grading managers who were tasked with managing the central graders.</p>

            <h1>Discovery</h1>
            <p>This project was triggered by a corporate push to reduce the costs associated with running a boot camp
              course. Looking at all costs related to courses, one suggestion was to reduce the number of TAs to a
              class.</p>
            <p>But another problem remained that would only be exacerbated by the reduction of TAs: TAs graded homework
              assignments and many classes were already behind on homework grading.</p>
            <p>Through brainstorming with stakeholders, the idea to centralize the homework grading process came about.
              A team of dedicated graders would work to grade assignments across three of Trilogy’s program offerings.
            </p>
            <p> Trilogy already had a centralization effort that included services like centralized tutoring for
              students and would later include a Slack-based platform for answering students’ technical questions. The
              existing centralization team would manage the new central graders since the infrastructure was already in
              place.</p>
          </div>
        </section>

        <section class="row portfolio-row">
          <div class="col-md-12">
            <h1>Assumptions and constraints</h1>
            <p>A few assumptions were made during the initial design of the project: a custom platform could be built to
              power the grading operation side of centralized grading; the platforms where students turned in
              assignments could be integrated into to both get assignments into the new central grading platform and
              deliver feedback back to the student-facing platforms; central graders would be hired to make up the
              central grading team; and central grading managers would be hired to deliver communications to graders in
              addition to managing day-to-day administration.</p>
            <p>Early in the process the technical feasibility of integrating into the Learning Management Systems
              (LMSes) was looked into. Trilogy ran online classes through an off-the-shelf LMS called Canvas, and
              in-person classes through an in-house LMS called Bootcamp Spot.</p>
            <p>Because Bootcamp Spot was build in-house, it would be easy to modify. The design team was free to make
              changes to Bootcamp Spot when adding new features to central grading. However, Canvas was not as flexible.
              Canvas is a closed-source, hosted LMS and some features were not changeable without building LTI (Learning
              Tools Interoperability) add-ons that would function as applets inside the Canvas instance. This would
              become a problem as the assignment submission and grading tools built into Canvas were not a flexible as
              other features in the LMS.</p>

            <p>One problem the team raised early on was about members of the instructional team having a say in the
              grades assigned by central graders. TAs and instructors had unique insight into students’ performance, so
              it was important for them to be both kept up to date with students’ homework grades, but also it was
              important for them to have a say if they felt a grade was unfair.</p>
            <div class="welton"><strong>How might we include instructional team members in the grading process?</strong>
            </div>
            <p>A TA approval step was added to the central grading process. After a grader graded an assignment, it
              would go to the in-class TA to approve. If approved, the grade would be visible to the student and if it
              was not approved, it would be flagged for review by the grader.</p>

            <p>When a grader logged into the platform, they would be presented with a list of assignments that had been
              submitted by students. Graders could claim assignments which would then put the assignment in the grader’s
              personal queue and take them off of the queue for other graders. Graders had the ability to filter
              assignments on the queues to allow them to find assignments that would fit their specializations. Inactive
              filters would be shown as slightly transparent to indicate their status while active filters would be both
              opaque and also have a blue dot next to them. Hovering over the “?” icon in the filter sidebar would
              display a note explaining that particular filter.</p>
