              <h1>Overview</h1>
              <p>Savannah, Georgia is a beautiful city full of exciting sights, historic landmarks, enchanting nature, good ‘ol homestyle country cookin, and so much more. At the north end of historic downtown is Broughton Street, the main shopping drag of the area. This was once a hot spot for tourists and locals alike, but the scene on Broughton has quickly been changing. King Street in Charleston, South Carolina is becoming a big competitor and Broughton Street has failed to keep up. In the recent years, much of Broughton has been bought up by big developers and rent has risen thus driving out many local shops. Big box shops like H&M and J-Crew now take the place of small local restaurants and little mom-and-pop gift shops.</p>
<p>Our objective was to create an experience that would be uniquely Savannah and not only bring people to Broughton, but also keep them on Broughton. </p>

              <h2>Users and audience</h2>
              <p>The users of the end product would be the everyday shoppers on Broughton Street. In the beginning, our team was not sure who we would target, but very quickly into our research phase we realized that families with children would be are target — both local families and tourists alike.</p>

              <h1>Contextual research</h1>
              <p>Our research phase included talking directly to store owners on Broughton Street and also interviewing individuals we found on Broughton Street and the immediately surrounding area. Through our research we discovered families were one of the main groups that felt unfulfilled while on Broughton. We quickly realized as we synthesized our research that families with children were the group for whom we would design with the goal of creating an experience that would keep both guardians and kids entertained while also keeping them on Broughton Street to better drive business to local shops and sights.</p>

              <p>Our research pointed us in the direction of designing an interactive experience for families. As we went through the ideation process we focused on a way to create a memorable and immersive experience for both guardians and children. We wanted this experience to directly connect with the shops And sights on Broughton so we could improve foot traffic to local businesses while providing a fun thing for families to do.</p>

              <h1>Pilot testing</h1>
              <p>We tested the final prototype in a pilot with five families with children. One family went on the entire tour with us, hitting every single spot on the path. We received positive feedback and families were overwhelmingly thrilled with the experience. Most importantly we got the stamp of approval from the kids, and they’re the harshest critics!</p>
