              <h1>Overview</h1>
              <p>The Heady Information Technology System was designed for Smoke Cartel, Inc. as a centralized management application and documentation resource for the company’s information technology department.</p>

              <h2>Users and audience</h2>
              <p>Smoke Cartel had a small group of people who had their hands in the IT operations. I was the principal IT systems designer and admin, but there were also company executives who needed information on IT systems as well as future developers who would need access to information gathered by internal applications. Employees of the company also needed a way to get quick IT support, which needed to be kept organized and associated with devices for better tracking.</p>

              <h1>Discovery</h1>
              <p>There were a lot of different things that were needed from this application, and scope creep became a concern. First, we looked into all the needs we had in the company. This included conducting 1:1 interviews with multiple staff members from all departments to see how we could make their work lives easier when it came to the company’s IT systems and also to gain insight into how we could stop problems before they happened.</p>

                <ul><li>Smoke Cartel started small and grew rapidly and thus had a variety of different equipment. Some equipment was unreliable and it was critical to be able to track issues on specific devices to know when it was time to replace them and to understand bigger issues.</li></ul>
                <li>Living documentation on the entire IT system that was easily editable and secure</li>
                <li>A dashboard for custom build applets for information and control</li>
                <ul><li>A big issue for Smoke Cartel at the time was network connectivity issues. An applet had been developed to test if devices were online and then alert the IT staff if there was a device offline. We needed a way to manage that app and see its data. But this was not the only custom applet written. We wanted a way to control and see the data of all the applets in our system.</li></ul>

                </li><li>Management application and API were written in PHP
                </li><li>Bootstrap was used for UI elements and grid structures for rapid development
                </li><li>A custom-made token authentication system was developed in PHP and Python for securing the system
                </li><li>The application was hosted on an Ubuntu server running an Apache web server
                </li></ul>

              <h1>Outcomes</h1>
              <p>This project was my passion project for the final year of my time at Smoke Cartel. It transformed my daily work life by making asset management and tech support tasks much easier and it was an integral part of our development team’s ability to find documentation on the systems in place.</p>
              <p>Technical issues that used to take three or more days to learn about and fix were down to half a day from report to repair.</p>
              <h2 class="pt-3">Lessons learned</h2>
              <p>If I were to reembark on this project I would have absolutely made a mobile app. Since mobile web browsers restrict access to the device’s cameras, barcode scanning was not possible on our Android and iOS devices. This meant that the tagging system wasn't be as useful as it could have been.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, the naming conventions established for asset management ended up generating asset IDs that were too long to be quickly entered into support ticket creation dialogue boxes or remembered by anyone other than the IT staff.</p>
              <p>The overall project could also have benefited from more time spent in the wireframing stage. The final version, although effective, could have used the available space more efficiently. Unfortunately, time constraints meant that the project needed to be pushed to prototyping as quickly as possible.</p>
