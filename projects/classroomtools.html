              <p>In January 2017 I started as a Teacher's Assistant for Georgia Tech Savannah's MERN stack web application development boot camp. Over the next 3+ years I would become a teacher for this course and then switch from teaching web development to teaching UX/UI design. During this time I have tried out many things in the classroom to make learning more fun and to help me out. These are the projects that "made the cut" to be shared here. Interested in trying these out in your classroom? I made these quickly to be utilities, so they aren't world-class or especially easy to set up â€” please <a href="https://hannahap.com/about.html" title="Contact Hannah A. Patellis">send me a message</a>! I would love to talk to you.</p>

              <p><strong>Houses of Design Olympics</strong> is a game for use in UX/UI design boot camps. Students compete through various challenges that encourage extra curricular work to earn points for their house. Twice during the class a celebration is held to congratulate the winning house. This project includes written guides as well as a new MERN application for managing house points.</p>
