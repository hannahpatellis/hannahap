              <p>I started working for Trilogy Education Services (now a 2U Inc. brand) in January 2017 as an instructor of full-stack web application development boot camps. In March of the following year, I was hired to work full-time inside the company that was powering the boot camps I was teaching.</p>
              <p>When I joined the Trilogy product team as a UX/UI designer, there was no system in place for integrating UX/UI design into the product creation and development process. It became one of my first tasks to create a plan to integrate a UX/UI framework in the company.</p>
              <p>Trilogy does development work in two week agile sprints and the initial internal process I designed would do design and research work one to three sprints ahead of when developers would take over to complete execution work. During that time I meet with stakeholders and product managers before conducting research and continuing with the design process. At the end of the design process and after final consultation with stakeholders and product managers, design specifications are created and handed off to developers. During development, I work closely alongside developers to insure the experiences and visual designs were being implemented as intended. Lucky for me, Trilogy uses React.js for frontend development so it is easy to speak their language and understand how development is being executed.</p>

              <p>During my time at Trilogy I have worked on a wide range of products. Trilogy creates and facilitates technical boot camps at major universities across the globe. They are also the employer of all instructors; TAs; and centralized tutors, learning assistants, and assignment graders that work with the classes they facilitate. The applications I work on (and have worked on in the past) are student-facing as well as instructional staff and centralized support-facing. Insuring a quality experience was paramount for student-facing Learning Management Systems, but also making sure that instructional staff and central support staff-facing tools were efficient was of high concern.</p>
