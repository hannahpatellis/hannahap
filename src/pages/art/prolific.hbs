        <p class="mb-1">PROlific is an art management application written primarily in PHP and using MySQL as a database.</p>
        <p class="mb-1">This piece of web-based software allows artists to keep an ongoing database of their work complete with detailed notes and images and allows guests to login and view specific pieces. I started writing PROlific for a few reasons, one being I wanted to be able to see all my work in one place and another being I wanted to have a complete database that I could use for whatever kinds of projects I wanted.</p>
        <p>The development of PROlific is ongoing and the current state of the software is alpha at best. The code (along with more screenshots) is publicly available on Github and many more features are still to come.</p>
