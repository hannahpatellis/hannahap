        <p>As happy as I was for my two best friends when they had their first child, there was a lot of grief that came with it. Even though I know it’ll happen to me one day I know that, as a trans woman, it won’t happen in the same way. My introduction to motherhood will look different. This short zine helped me process the intense emotions of that time in a safe place and in a comfortable format.</p>
