        <p>This zine chronicles my first 20 sexual partners, some just escapades and others profound relationships. Throughout this journey from age 18 to around age 27 I have come out, again and again, started transitioning, and underwent gender affirming care (including gender affirming surgery). Naturally this impacted my relationships, both sexual and otherwise! A fun story, with some intense moments, this zine follows sex, relationships, and growth.</p>
