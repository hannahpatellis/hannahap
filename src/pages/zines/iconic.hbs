        <p>After nearing losing my life in 2022 to severe complications from an emergency appendectomy, a new health crisis quickly came to the forefront. While waiting for doctor appointments, lab tests, imaging, and results, I was sitting in a puddle of fear â€” after working so hard on myself and after working so hard to find a fervent love of life, would it all come crashing down earlier than expected? During this time I was struggling with my art too. This zine fell into place as I made art (even though I was frustrated and creatively blocked) and wrote about the anxiety of my life being cut short.</p>
