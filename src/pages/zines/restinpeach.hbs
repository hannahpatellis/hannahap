        <p>When my orange and white bff of 8 years passed away I was destroyed. I started writing to help process and express my feelings on the day I said goodbye and continued for a few days after. I didnâ€™t want this zine to be all sadness however. This zine tells the story of Peaches and Cream (Peach for short) from the day I got her in Savannah, Georgia to the day I had to say goodbye on our couch in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The goodbyes examine the toll of having to choose euthanasia for your pet and the grief, guilt, and heartbreak that follows.</p>
